This project has several goals : 
1. help me manage my job search by keeping track of jobs statuses and applications
2. learn as much and as fast as possible about Spring Boot, Hexagonal Architecture, Clean Architecture, MongoDB and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and lots of other things I will forget (or not)
3. Make me scream "Man, TDD is so cool and efficient" then  go to 5. or 6., each with a 50% probability
4. Make me scream "Man, TDD si so counterintuitive and inefficient" then go to 5. or 6., each with a 50% probabilty
5. Go back to 3. or 4., each with a 50% probability
6. Try, fail, misunderstand, try again, fail again, succeed, do better, wish I knew more and better, refactor, unlearn, relearn, fail again, succeed, question everything, go to sleep
